# Dennis Durmuş – Mobile App & Software Projects

## Overview  
This repository serves as a public-facing portfolio for my mobile application and software projects. As a professional mobile developer with a focus on Flutter (for iOS & Android) and Firebase, I build maintainable applications that prioritise business value, user experience (UX) and scalable architecture. Source code remains private to protect intellectual property; however, this README provides detailed project outlines and showcases the results with high‑quality screenshots.

## Core Skills  
- **Mobile development with Flutter**  
- **Clean architecture & modular code structures**  
- **Role‑ & rights-based access control**  
- **User‑centred product development**  
- **Practical problem solving**

## Featured Project: Styling4You  
Styling4You is a digital salon and appointment management app designed for beauty studios and salons. It streamlines bookings, service catalogues and client communication.

### Problem  
Salons often rely on manual appointment books and fragmented communication channels. This leads to missed bookings, inefficient scheduling and poor customer experience.

### Solution  
Styling4You offers a unified platform where clients can browse services, book appointments and receive confirmations while salon owners manage their calendar, services and staff availability.

### Key Features  
- Service catalogue with detailed descriptions  
- Real‑time appointment scheduling and availability management  
- Notifications & reminders for clients and staff  
- Role‑based access for salon owners and employees
